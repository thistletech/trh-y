This repository contains the tools and instructions for releasing a Thistle OTA
update bundle signed with a key protected by a YubiKey.

## FAQ

- Q: What types of YubiKeys will work?

  A: Any device in the YubiKey 5 series should work. Earlier versions of
  YubiKeys *may* work, but are not thoroughly tested.

- Q: Can the private signing key be exported outside of a provisioned YubiKey
  so I can back it up?

  A: No. The private key cannot be exported from the YubiKey hardware.

- Q: What if a provisioned YubiKey is lost, stolen or broken?

  A: Although the private signing key cannot be exported/leaked from the
  YubiKey, losing a production signing key can be catastrophic. To mitigate the
  risk, one may provision multiple YubiKeys, and add the associated public keys
  to `tuc`'s configuration JSON file for redundancy. The YubiKeys used
  in production signing should be kept safe. Specifically, an organization should
  consider establishing a key update process for fielded devices, and designing
  and performing regular disaster recover exercises to mitigate the risk of a lost
  key. Production keys should always be taken seriously!

- Q: We cannot easily update public signing keys in our fielded devices. Is
  there an alternative?

  A: If your devices cannot update the OTA bundle public signing keys easily
  after they leave the manufacturing facility (e.g., keys are fused in
  hardware), you may consider managing your signing keys using a Could Key
  Management System (KMS), for which hardware failures are practically not a
  concern (you do need to have a Cloud account). Thistle provides an external
  signing tool [trh-k](https://github.com/thistletech/trh-k) to help you do it
  with ease.

## System Requirements

You need

- MacOS (`x86_64` or `aarch64`) or Linux (`x86_64`, tested on Ubuntu)
- A [YubiKey](https://www.yubico.com/products/) (tested on YubiKey 5)

## Provision YubiKey for Signing (One-Time Setup)

This step only needs to be done once per release signing key.

- First, clone this repository, including its submodule.

  ```bash
  # use --recursive instead of --recurse-submodules for older Git versions
  git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/thistletech/trh-y.git
  ```

  Or (if you did not use the `--recursive` option when cloning the repository)

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/thistletech/trh-y.git
  cd trh-y
  git submodule update --init --recursive
  ```

- Follow [these
  instructions](https://github.com/thistletech/yubisign/blob/main/README.md#install-dependencies)
  to install dependencies of
  [yubisign](https://github.com/thistletech/yubisign).

- Generate a new `pivit` key pair in the YubiKey for OTA bundle signing

  Under the directory root of `trh-y`

  ```bash
  $ thistle-bin/keygen-y
  # Example output
  Please add the following public key to the public_keys array in TRH configuration:
  pivit: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
  ```

  Save the public key value for the initialization step later, or one can run
  `keygen-y` again to print the public key value to the console.

## Create Device Project and Obtain Access Token (One-Time Setup)

1. Login to the [Thistle portal](https://app.thistle.tech/projects/), and create
   a new project where your fleet of devices associated with the OTA bundle are
   managed. In the example below, we name the project "yubikey signing".

   ![Create New Project](img/new_project.png "Create New Project")

2. In the newly created project "yubikey signing", in the upper right corner,
   click the button "Access Token" to obtain the API token to be used as
   `THISTLE_TOKEN` in the initialization step.

   ![Obtain Access Token](img/access_token.png "Obtain Access Token")

## Initialization (One-Time Setup)

In the project initialization step, we generate a release manifest file
(`manifest.json`) and a device configuration file (`config.json`) using the
Thistle Release Helper (`trh`).

- The manifest file will be used by a release operator, with the help of `trh`,
  to describe an OTA bundle for devices in the project.

- The device configuration file will be provisioned into a device where the
  Thistle Update Client (`tuc`) runs, and can be used as a boilerplate template
  for subsequent devices added to the project.

On a Linux or macOS machine where the provisioned YubiKey is inserted,
initialize the project as follows.

```bash
# Create an empty "release" directory for the tutorial, and change to it
$ mkdir release
$ cd release
# Clone this repository
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/thistletech/trh-y.git
# Activate Hermit, and run subsequent commands in Hermit environment
$ . trh-y/bin/activate-hermit
# Paste the "Access Token" of the project obtained from Thistle portal, and type
# enter + ctrl-d
trh-yüêö $ export THISTLE_TOKEN=$(cat)
trh-yüêö $ trh init --persist /path/to/device-persist-storage \
  --public-key <PUBLIC_KEY>
# Example:
# trh init --persist /tmp/persist \
#  --public-key pivit: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
...
Manifest generated at: "./manifest.json"
Configuration generated at path "./config.json"
```

Here, `<PUBLIC_KEY>` is the public key value shown in the YubiKey provisioning
step.

- An example of `config.json` created in this step.

  ```json
  {
          "name": "mydevice",
          "persistent_directory": "/tmp/persist",
          "device_enrollment_token": "redacted_device_enrollment_token",
          "public_keys": ["pivit: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"]
  }
  ```

  This configuration file can be used as a template for other devices in the
  same project. While `persistent_directory`, `device_enrollment_token` and
  `public_keys` values are shared by all devices in the project, the fields
  `name` and`device_id` can be device unique, and customizable according to a
  customer's device management setting.

  Note that [Thistle Update Client
  (TUC)](https://docs.thistle.tech/update_client/overview) and Thistle's backend
  by default assume a "self-provisioning (aka self-enrollment)" model: Suppose
  `device_id` is missing from `config.json`, and `device_enrollment_token` is
  valid.  During the first HTTP request from TUC to the backend `device_id` is
  not present. In this case, this request will be viewed as a "device
  provisioning" request (authorized by `device_enrollment_token`): a new, unique
  `device_id` will be automatically created on the backend, and returned to the
  client to persist.  Subsequent client-initiated requests will have this
  `device_id` value included for device identification.

  Thistle's OTA update system can also be customized to support a device key
  provisioning mechanism with pre-generated, pre-configured `device_name` and
  `device_id`, if it's better suited for a customer's device manufacturing
  needs.

  ```json
  {
    "comment": null,
    "id": "01GK5TNHH687GMXA18ZSS43JC4",

## Prepare, Sign and Release OTA Bundle

As with [File Update](https://docs.thistle.tech/getting_started/file) and [Full
System Update](https://docs.thistle.tech/getting_started/rpi), we use `trh`'s
subcommands `prepare` and `release` to prepare, sign and release OTA bundles,
but also supply the `--external-sign` argument for YubiKey signing.

Let's use the following file update case as an example.

In the `release` directory on a Linux or macOS machine where the provisioned
YubiKey is inserted, run the follow commands. Make sure `manifest.json` is
directly under `release/`.

```bash
# Activate Hermit, and run subsequent commands in Hermit environment
$ . trh-y/bin/activate-hermit
# Paste the "Access Token" of the project obtained from Thistle portal, and type
# enter + ctrl-d
trh-yüêö $ export THISTLE_TOKEN=$(cat)
# Prepare a local OTA bundle
trh-yüêö $ mkdir -p rel/tmp
trh-yüêö $ echo "This is a test" > rel/tmp/test.txt
trh-yüêö $ trh --external-sign "trh-y/thistle-bin/sign-y" prepare -t=./rel -f=/
Read manifest at "./manifest.json"
Processed file "./rel/tmp/test.txt"

Manifest uploaded successfully
Local compressed artifacts removed
```

To update an existing release, re-run `trh prepare` and `trh release` commands
with the `--external-sign` argument exactly as above, and as described
[here](https://docs.thistle.tech/get_started/file#update-an-existing-release),
to get the manifest updated and signed, and OTA bundle uploaded to Thistle
backend.

## Test Release Update

On a device running `tuc`, run the following command to test the released OTA
bundle, using `config.json`. This is similar to what is described
[here](https://docs.thistle.tech/get_started/file#upload-and-test-deployed-release).

```bash
trh-yüêö $ tuc --log-level=info -c config.json
...
!! setting update status to Pass
.. signature verified with public key #0 type pivit
.. reported data to server
~~ next check in 3600s
```
